= May I insert Law of Attraction chat area inside the sidebar? =

Chat area requires at least 480 pixels of width to look nice. So narrow sidebars might not be suitable
Best is to dedicate separate page for a chat and use custom marker to build chat window, such as:
[loachat 800x600]
Above marker will create custom chat window of 800 pixels width and 600 pixels height.
